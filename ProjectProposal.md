#Project Proposal

###Project Description


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be working with the Twitter API. Specfically the Restful public API. Twitter is a major social media site that allows you to "tweet" about a thought or a picture/video. Twitter themselves have collected the data to allow eveyone to use. This specific api allows you not only to read data but to also write "tweets" to Twitter. We accesed it through the Twitter data and web site that gives you documentation about this specific API. One thing to keep in mind is this API only allows 100,000 user tokens.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our target audience is marketing teams looking for better ways to reach their aduiences and what they are looking for. This report would be able to alter it's informations as trends change, and as events happen.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This report will tell the marketing teams what the most talked about places are so they can better alter their adds to those places. It will also tell them what the most talked about subjects on Twitter are so they can better understand what this age group cares about. It will also include demographic imformation like the different age groups, and gender to be able to alter the makreting techniques per different demographics.

###Technical Description


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current plans for the format of our final product are to make it an HTML page (that perhaps links ot other HTML pages). If after wednesday's class we feel like shiny might be a better option then we will create a website with shiny. We plan on utilizing the twitter API for most of our data. 
We will most definitely be using dplyr, and json in order to select the information we need. We might also use curl to curl our urls, we might use knitr to make different tables.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions we will be answering range from what locations are most tweeted about to what the majority of demographics that are present on twitter. We will be awnsering the questions to help marketing teams figure out how to target their advertisements to their target demographics. The major problem we might run into is how big the Twitter api is.
