"**Spartify**" was created by Samuel Tompkins, Alyxis Burks, Jeffrey Pinkstaff, and Evan Taylor under the instruction of Michael Freeman for his class, INFO 498F, at the University of Washington during Winter Quarter 2016.

This application utilizes the *Spotify* API to retrieve data about two user-chosen artists. This data is processed through an original algorithm to decide which artist is "better" based on the following variables:
- Popularity Index
- Number of Followers
- Popularity of Top Ten Songs

The application was written using a combination of R, Shiny, Plotly, and CSS, while collaboration was managed by Git and GitHub.

Thank you.
